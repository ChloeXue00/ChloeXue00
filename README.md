## 🔍 About Me

I'm currently a master's student in Systems, Control & Mechatronics at Chalmers, passionate about autonomous driving, ADAS functionality, and AI-based motion planning.  

I build control strategies, write technical blogs, and prototype end-to-end behaviors like **ACC with Cut-in/Cut-out handling, and Stop & Go moduls** , **LKA with Curvature Optimization**using simulators such as **CARLA**.  

My mission: *Bridge the gap between system-level product definition and low-level control behavior implementation.*

## 🚘 Featured Projects

### 🔧 Carla ACC Strategy Demo (WIP)
> End-to-end Adaptive Cruise Control demo with visualization, strategy transitions, and vehicle control via Python + CARLA.

- Strategy: Cruise / Follow / Brake / Cut-in / Stop & Go
- Input: Radar-like virtual data from CARLA
- Control: Acceleration commands via PID
- Output: Real-time visualization + debug HUD
